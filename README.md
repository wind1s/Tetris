# Tetris (TDDE30)
## Quick start
Use "arrow keys" to move tetromino left, right and rotate clockwise, anticlockwise.
Press space to move the tetromino down faster.

Press "escape" to pause the game and bring up a basic pause menu.

When the game is over you can save your score to a highscore list.

### Power ups
This tetris is a "free game" meaning you can use powerups without limits. 
Press "F" to activate fallthrough which esentially turns off collision with other placed
tetrominos. Press "H" to activate heavy which pushes other squares down with a collision
if there is empty space below.
